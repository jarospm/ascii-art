ASCII is a character encoding introduced in the 1960s and is still in use today. 

The principle of ASCII art is that completely white pixels are represented by a space, black by a character with "a lot of ink," such as #, and grayscale levels are conveyed using other characters.

ASCII Art Studio allows users to interactively experiment with the art form and automatically render image files into ASCII. 

The program can read image formats such as JPG and PNG. 

Using a simple command language, users are able to manage multiple images simultaneously, adjust contrast and exposure, and experiment with different output sizes.
