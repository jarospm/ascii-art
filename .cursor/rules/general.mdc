These are preferred approaches and libraries for this project.

## Tools

- use the pillow module (Python Image Library) to handle image files 
- use json for serialization (i.e., transforming a data structure or class into a
text representation on a file)
- use the re module for the command language
- use the math module if it simplifies the implementation


## Converting to Grayscale
Transforming pixel images into ASCII art is easier when color images are converted to grayscale. 
This can be done simply with the following conversion instruction: new_img = img . convert ( mode ='L ')


## Pixels
By reading the grayscale level of an image point, a pixel, you obtain a numerical value that can be converted into a character.
pos = (x , y )
grey = img . getpixel ( pos )

Note that the getpixel method takes a single argument, which should be a tuple. In the example above, ùë• and ùë¶ are the coordinates of a point in the image.
